### App Description and User Flows

#### **App Description:**
The boletos management system is a comprehensive web and mobile platform designed to streamline the process of managing contracts and boletos (billing documents) for businesses and their clients. It serves two main user groups: backoffice users and final users. Backoffice users, typically administrative staff or managers, utilize the system to import, manage, and maintain contracts, generate boletos, and provide clients with access to their respective documents. Final users, or clients, access the system to view and download boletos related to their contracts. The system emphasizes security, ease of use, and efficient management, ensuring that all parties can access and process contract-related information with minimal hassle.

#### **Backoffice User Flow:**

1. **Login/Authentication:**
   - Backoffice users log in to the platform using their credentials to access the dashboard and management features.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Upon successful login, users are directed to a dashboard that displays summary statistics, recent activity, and quick access to manage contracts and boletos.

3. **Import Contracts:**
   - Users can import contract data in bulk using a spreadsheet format. The system processes the data, creating or updating contract entries in the database.

4. **Manage Contracts:**
   - The core functionality allows users to add new contracts, view detailed information on existing contracts, edit contract details, or delete contracts as needed.

5. **Generate Boletos:**
   - For each contract, backoffice users can generate boletos, which are then made available for final users to view and download.

6. **Search and Filter Contracts:**
   - Users can quickly find specific contracts or boletos using a variety of search and filter criteria, such as contract number, client name, or date range.

7. **Logout:**
   - Securely exit the system to ensure that access is protected.

#### **Final User Flow:**

1. **Registration/Login (If Registration is Required):**
   - Final users create an account or log in to access their personal dashboard, which lists the contracts and boletos available to them.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - After logging in, final users see a summary of their contracts and can access their boletos. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to manage and view relevant documents.

3. **View Contracts:**
   - Users can view a list of their contracts, including details such as contract number, validity, and associated boletos.

4. **Download Boletos:**
   - For each contract, final users can download boletos in a digital format (e.g., PDF). This feature allows users to easily access and save their billing documents for payment processing outside the system.

5. **Account Management:**
   - Users have the option to update their personal information or account settings, ensuring their details remain current and accurate.

6. **Logout:**
   - Final users can securely log out of the platform, ensuring their information remains protected.
